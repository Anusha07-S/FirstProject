    <h2>India's No.1 Gambling group</h2>

    <p>Gambling is defined as the wagering of money or something of value (the "stakes") on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the possibility of winning an increased return. It is a global commercial activity that has existed in nearly every society throughout history, encompassing various forms such as casino games, lotteries, sports betting, and online poker. While many people engage in gambling as a form of leisure or entertainment, most able to do so without significant negative impacts, all forms carry an element of risk. </p>
    <p>For a minority of individuals, gambling can escalate into a serious addiction or disorder, which is a recognized mental health condition. Problem gambling can lead to severe consequences, including financial ruin, mental health issues (such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts), relationship breakdowns, job loss, and involvement in crime to support the habit. These harms often extend beyond the individual gambler, negatively affecting an average of six others, including family and friends. Due to these potential negative social and economic consequences, the activity is often heavily regulated or banned in many jurisdictions, although it remains a significant source of tax revenue for some governments. </p>
